## Indian Liver Patient Data Analysis

This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) and basic predictive modeling on a publicly available dataset of liver patient records from India. The dataset is used to analyze the health conditions of individuals and identify patterns related to liver disease.

### 📊 Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to:

* Understand the distribution of various liver health indicators.
* Visualize the differences between patients with liver disease and those without.
* Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.
* Apply simple machine learning models to classify patients based on liver health.

### 📁 Dataset

* **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository
* **Attributes include**:

  * Age
  * Gender
  * Total Bilirubin
  * Direct Bilirubin
  * Alkaline Phosphatase
  * Alanine Aminotransferase
  * Aspartate Aminotransferase
  * Total Proteins
  * Albumin
  * Albumin and Globulin Ratio
  * Class (1 = Liver disease, 2 = No liver disease)

### 🔧 Technologies Used

* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas & NumPy
* Matplotlib & Seaborn
* Scikit-learn

### 📈 Key Features

* Visual analysis of liver-related health attributes
* Handling of missing data and categorical variables
* Basic classification using Logistic Regression and Decision Trees
* Model performance evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.

### ✅ Outcome

This project serves as a basic analytical and predictive modeling exercise for medical datasets and provides insight into the health patterns of liver patients in India.
